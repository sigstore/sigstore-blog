‚Äú*And lo, in the land of software package management, a system was born to bring order and trust. Sigstore was its name, and its mission was to sign packages with short-lived certificates, validated by a powerful OIDC provider. These signed packages were then placed in a transparency database for all to see, like a holy book open for all to read and verify. Sigstore was a beacon of hope in a chaotic world, shining brightly as a protector of software integrity.*‚Äù

Thanks, Daniel Feldman for [generating this (and many other)](https://twitter.com/d_feldman/status/1602405219928838144) Sigstore descriptions.

However you describe Sigstore, it‚Äôs undeniable that 2022 has been an incredible year for the project and its community. Not only was this the year of the [Sigstore GA](https://blog.sigstore.dev/sigstore-ga-ddd6ba67894d), but the project had an overwhelming amount of contributors:

- 450+ Contributing Individuals
- 70+ Contributing Organizations

### New Scientific Paper: ‚ÄúSigstore: Software Signing For Everybody‚Äù

A peer-reviewed research paper called *Sigstore: Software Signing for Everybody* authored by Zachary Newman, John Speed Meyers, and Santiago Torres-Arias was published at the 2022 ACM Computer and Communications Security (CCS) conference in Los Angeles, CA, an academic computer security conference, featuring publications from research universities around the world and industry labs at organizations like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon.

When this paper was drafted, 10 months ago, there were 2 million entries in the Rekor log; now there are over 7 million and counting!

### New Case Studies

Many companies are adopting Sigstore and are excited to share their story. We published three new Sigstore case studies from Autodesk, DB Schenker, and Verizon since the last roundup!

### Sigstore Landscape

The [Sigstore Landscape](https://blog.sigstore.dev/new-sigstore-landscape-add-your-signed-project-dda0517723b6) is filled up with projects signed by Sigstore. We want to give a shout-out to the latest additions: FluentBit, Istio, Karpenter, Keptn, Knative, Kubewarden, LinkerD, Pulumi, and Shipwright.

Also a special mention for Sigstore adoptions that aren‚Äôt yet on the landscape:

**LLVM:** Now signs with Sigstore to make it easier for users to verify that the packages came from llvm and to detect potential malicious signatures. Find it on [apt repo for Debian/Ubuntu](https://apt.llvm.org/) packages.

**Updatecli:** The latest release is now signed with Sigstore. [Read more](https://www.updatecli.io/)

**Kubernetes release:** The recent 1.26 Kubernetes release now signs all software artifacts with Sigstore, not just the container images. [Read more](https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/new-kubernetes-1-26-release-boosts-security-storage-teases-dynamic-resource-allocation)

### Language Client Updates

As many language ecosystems look to adopt Sigstore, work is underway to make it much, much easier. Here‚Äôs the latest on language client activity.

#### Java (sigstore-java)

A common sigstore-java library is being actively developed to be integrated into Java ecosystem tools such as Maven and Gradle. If you‚Äôd like to get involved in 2023 or keep up with the latest, please join the [Sigstore Java](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R7mL-IUrc2Z_LuOIvwDWshVuPQS_2VNE_cIQx4Oy5zw/edit) weekly calls.

#### Javascript (sigstore-js)

The npm community recently [accepted the RFC](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/main/accepted/0049-link-packages-to-source-and-build.md) to improve trust of npm packages using Sigstore and trusted build infrastructure. To integrate Sigstore into the npm cli directly, work is underway on a cosign client writing in javascript: sigstore-js. At a recent Sigstore Office Hours Brian de Hamer gave a [demo on the latest with sigstore-js](https://youtu.be/sOSFWWWwVkc?t=968).

#### Python (sigstore-python)

For Python, sigstore-python is working towards its 1.0 release, including work toward stabilizing an importable Python API. sigstore-python 0.9.0 [has just been released](https://twitter.com/8x5clPW2/status/1605996324167356416?s=20&t=bEOmFZgqfWf_1hum4gv-KA) and becomes the first version to use TUF to automagically establish trust in Sigstore‚Äôs public good instances. William Woodruff recently gave a demo of sigstore-python at Sigstore Office Hours. The demo included an overview of new policy support, [check out the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcCwXgHGV00&feature=youtu.be).

#### Rust (sigstore-rs)

Sigstore-rs is a crate for Rust to interact with Sigstore and [v0.6.0](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-rs/releases/tag/v0.6.0) just shipped. This release includes a ton of fixes and support for OCI Image signing. Sigstore and memory safety, all in one, what‚Äôs not to love?
