Last November, [Alpha-Omega] and [Trail of Bits] announced a
[collaboration to bring build provenance to homebrew-core].

Today, we are pleased to announce that the core of that work is live
and in public beta: [homebrew-core] is now using Sigstore to cryptographically
attest to all bottles built in the official [Homebrew] CI. This follows
last year's [npm provenance] feature, making Homebrew the second major
packaging ecosystem to adopt Sigstore!

In other words, going forwards, each bottle built by Homebrew will come with
a cryptographically verifiable statement binding the bottle’s content to the
specific workflow and other build-time metadata that produced it.

This metadata includes (among other things) the git commit and GitHub Actions
run ID for the workflow that produced the bottle, making it a
[SLSA Build L2]-compatible attestation:

This work is still in **early beta**, and involves features still
under [active development] within both Homebrew and GitHub.

However, for the adventurous, we recommend checking out the [Trail of Bits blog]
for a longer explainer on Homebrew's build provenance, how it was implemented,
and how early adopters can begin to play with it!
