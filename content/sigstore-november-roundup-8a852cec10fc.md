### Sigstore GA

The community has been working hard all year to accomplish this milestone, and we are thrilled that open source communities can now confidently rely on Sigstore for production-grade stable services for artifact signing and verification.

The 2022 Sigstore Award Winners are‚Ä¶

#### **Most Valuable Contributor**

This award is for the individual who has made a huge impact to the project this year.

üèÜ **Asra Ali ‚Äî** Asra has built many of the fundamental components in Rekor, and her work on the Sigstore TUF root of trust has been so critical to the security and GA launch for Sigstore. Beyond contributing directly to Sigstore, Asra has done a lot to build on top of Sigstore too with her work on SLSA!

#### **Best Evangelist**

This award is for the individual who has gone above and beyond to spread the word about Sigstore

üèÜ **Batuhan (developer-guy) Apaydin** ‚Äî developer-guy has done amazing work spreading knowledge around Sigstore in many different ways (blog posts, tweets, meetups, videos) which have been instrumental in bringing newcomers to the community, helping them get up to speed faster and feel more comfortable.

#### **Best User Adopter**

This award is for the individual, team or organization who have adopted Sigstore and have shared their impactful story with others

üèÜ [**SLSA GitHub Generators**](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) The SLSA GitHub Generator project hosts a collection of trusted builders that can produce SLSA Level 3 compliant provenance. This project is a key part of connecting Sigstore to the wider supply chain security ecosystem and has also been a key source of feedback on both feature enhancements as well as on regressions and issues in Sigstore services.

Congratulations! üéâ And thank you for everything you‚Äôve done for the Sigstore Community.

### Python Continues to Embrace Sigstore

The new release of [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/) was one of the most exciting Python releases in a while, not just for the significant speed upgrades, but also it is one of the first new versions of Python to be signed with Sigstore by default. Read more on [Sigstore verification of Python Releases](https://www.python.org/download/sigstore/).

In addition, [sigstore-python](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python) 0.7.0 was released this past month. This release now supports offline verification of Rekor entries, the ability to verify non-email identities, [and more](https://twitter.com/8x5clPW2/status/1588562179044691969?s=20&t=ZrxX9WmrfCbsc2z0unFYYA).
