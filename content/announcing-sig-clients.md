We are delighted to announce the creation of the Clients Special Interest Group
([sig-clients]) for the Sigstore project. This exciting new initiative marks the
first SIG for Sigstore and serves as an experiment in organizing efforts across
the Sigstore project.

The [sig-clients repository][sig-clients] is your one-stop shop for all things
related to Sigstore clients across various languages and ecosystems. This group
has the following mission:

> Make Sigstore clients across languages/ecosystems easy-to-write, compatible,
> and secure by providing shared designs/documentation, data formats, and test
> suites.

The SIG does not control the various Sigstore clients, but instead tries to
make the jobs of their maintainers as easy as possible.

The project roadmap (available in full in the repository) focuses on enhancing
Cosign, the most widely-used client, in the short term. This includes improving
user experience with policy enhancements and better identity assertion
guidance, supporting language clients, and refining documentation. The
medium-term goal is to increase Cosign's flexibility, with a focus on
personalizing PKI and private deployments, expanding policy enhancements, and
improving testing methods.  Finally, long-term plans include developing a
plumbing and porcelain model for Cosign, integrating with TUF/in-toto, and
devising ways to reduce the amount of work to create new Sigstore clients.

If you'd like to get involved, the [repository][sig-clients] lists ways to do
so, including meetings to attend and Slack channels to join.
