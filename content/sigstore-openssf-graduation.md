## Sigstore Graduates: A Monumental Step Towards Secure Software

Supply chain security took a giant leap forward this month as Sigstore officially became a graduated project within the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF).
This milestone is a testament to Sigstore's maturity, adoption, and its undeniable impact on making the creation and distribution of software more trustworthy.

## What is Sigstore?
For those unfamiliar, Sigstore is a suite of tools designed to streamline secure software signing & verification of artifacts such as binaries, containers and attestations.
In a world increasingly concerned about supply chain attacks, Sigstore offers a solution that brings transparency and integrity to the software ecosystem.
Key components include:

* [**Cosign**](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign): A user-friendly tool to sign and verify software artifacts and container images.
  In addition to Cosign, each ecosystem has its own platform-specific tooling, such as [sigstore-python](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python) or [sigstore-js](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-js).
* [**Fulcio**](https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio): A certificate authority to issue short-lived identity-based code-signing certificates.
* [**Rekor**](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor): A transparency log providing a tamper-resistant record of software signatures and metadata.

Free-to-use instances of Fulcio and Rekor are operated by the community for the public good.

## Why Graduation Matters

Within the OpenSSF, projects achieve "graduated" status when they demonstrate a high level of stability, a thriving community,
well-defined governance, and adherence to security best practices. Sigstore's graduation underscores several important things:

* **Trust and Reliability**: Sigstore has undergone significant vetting, gaining the trust of major stakeholders and making it an even more compelling
  choice for ecosystems and organizations seeking to elevate their software security.
* **Widespread Adoption**: Its graduation speaks to the growing recognition of code signing and transparency as key elements in modern software supply chain security.
* **A Thriving Ecosystem**: Sigstore boasts a vibrant community of contributors and users driving innovation and ensuring the project's continued success.
