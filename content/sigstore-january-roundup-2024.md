Welcome to the January edition of the Sigstore Roundup! This is a regular summary of Sigstore news, events, releases and other happenings.

### Events

#### KubeCon Europe 2024

The next KubeCon Europe will be held on **19th â€“ 22nd March**.

There are serveral Sigstore related talks and events planned for KubeCon Europe, including:

- [Securing the Supply Chain with Sigstore Artifacts Signatures at Scale - Dmitry Savintsev & Yonghe Zhao, Yahoo](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1YeNE)
- [Navigating the Software Supply Chain Defense Landscape - Marina Moore & Aditya Sirish A Yelgundhalli, New York University](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1YeO3/navigating-the-software-supply-chain-defense-landscape-marina-moore-aditya-sirish-a-yelgundhalli-new-york-university)
- [Contribfest: Enable Additional Signing Mechanisms for TUF and in-toto: No Cryptography Skills Required](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1YkRE/contribfest-enable-additional-signing-mechanisms-for-tuf-and-in-toto-no-cryptography-skills-required)

#### FOSDEM 2024

The next FOSDEM will be held in Brussels, Belgium on the **3rd & 4th February 2024**
along with a talk on Sigstore and SLSA by John Viega.

- [Making it easy to get to SLSA level 2, John Viega](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2877-making-it-easy-to-get-to-slsa-level-2/)

#### Sigstore Community Meeting

### Interesting Discussions and Developments

#### Cryptographic Agility

Some very interesting work is happening in the Sigstore community around cryptographic agility. This includes support of further signature algorithms and the integration of post-quantum signatures schemes.

Community member William Woodruff had this to say about the work:

> Over the past month, we've revisited the Configurable Crypto Algorithms proposal and have begun to work towards signature algorithm agility on various core Sigstore codebases (Fulcio, Rekor, cosign, sigstore-go, and the protobuf-specs). We've already made significant progress towards enabling agility within a safe set of signature suites, and are quickly moving towards a state where the public Sigstore instances will be able to handle Ed25519 keypairs and signatures. Longer term, we'll be using that agility to investigate integrations of post-quantum signatures schemes, including hash-based signature schemes like LMS and LM-OTS (the latter being a perfect fit for Sigstore's "keyless" model).

The original proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18vTKFvTQdRt3OGz6Qd1xf04o-hugRYSup-1EAOWn7MQ/edit#heading=h.op2lvfrgiugr)

#### sigstore-python: DSSE support has landed!

Support for DSSE has been added to the sigstore-python library. This is a
significant milestone for the project. The DSSE support is currently in a
pre-release state and we welcome all feedback and contributions.

For those unfamiliar with DSSE (Dead Simple Signing Envelope), it is a protocol
for signing and verifying software artifacts using an embedded payload that is
passed over with a signature. This is in contrast to the traditional detached
signature approach.

You can view the pull request [here](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/commit/bb9b1a0fc689f074a10e3f314dbf8a7486705f78)

A release will be made shortly.
