This year, Sigstore is participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) for the first time!

### What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration that encourages people to contribute to open source. Digital Ocean, along with its partners, hosts it every year.

### Who can participate?

Everyone and anyone is welcome to participate in Hacktoberfest (and to contribute to Sigstore).

The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt.
