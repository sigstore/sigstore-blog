### NPM + Sigstore: A first look at sigstore-js

Last month we shared Githubâ€™s plans to [use Sigstore for the npm package manager](https://github.blog/2022-08-08-new-request-for-comments-on-improving-npm-security-with-sigstore-is-now-open/) and the recent donation of sigstore-js to the community. This month, Brian DeHamer of Github joined us at Sigstore Office Hours to give a first look at the new library that can be used for signing and verifying signatures with Javascript/Typescript. Check out the demo here:
