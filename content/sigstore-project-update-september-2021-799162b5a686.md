Well another month has passed and as per usual in the sigstore world, a lot has happened!

Since our last update in August we have **over double the amount of contributors** working on sigstore! There has been a leap from 46 to 98! wow!

### Sigstore talk

On Wednesday October 13 11:55am — 12:30pm. Dan Lorenc and Bob Callaway will be performing a talk on sigstore ‘How we started, where we are, and where we are headed’.

### Project Updates

#### **Rekor**

Our transparency log is edging close to a 1.0 release now, while we just fine tune the API for our approach to sharding.

sharding is required if ever a corruption occurs, this allows us to freeze the former log and create a new one, with no loss of data or service.

Once sharding is landed, we cut 1.0 and rekor is then considered production grade.

#### cosign

cosign is developing fast. Work is being carried out to refactor the CLI over to [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) and we recently included github’s OIDC into cosign (more on the OIDC change under fulcio), along with support for GCP environments without workload identity.

cosign is now at [version v1.2.1](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/tag/v1.2.1)

#### fulcio

GitHub recently released its own OpenID connect functionality, which enables sigstore to provide an even more seamless keyless signing experience.

With fulcio keyless signing it is required that a developer be present to perform the OpenID connect grant. Sigstore clients open a browser to our oauth2 server, which then prompts the user to ‘login’ with a provider account (Google, Github, Microsoft etc). This grant then allows us to obtain the email addresss of the user and place it into a sigstore X509 signing certificate.

Now the above works great for what we term an ‘attended signing’, but what about ‘unattended’, e.g. a headless machine with no human present to interact with the browser to allow the grant.

With Github OIDC now, we can provide an unattended experience to signing artefacts (such as a container image) within a github action. The great factor here, is that GitHub have added sigstore as an OIDC Audience (idToken Field).

Keep an eye out for an entry on this blog on how to get set up for unattended sigstore signing!
